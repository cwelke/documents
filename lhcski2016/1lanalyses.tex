In the analyses with exactly one lepton, three separate searches are performed.
In the first search, a search for direct stop pair production, the signal region is defined by having
exactly 1 lepton, njets, btags, and large MET.
After these cuts are made, the largest background comes from SM ttbar to dilepton, where one of the leptons is lost, leading to increased \MET.
The results of this analysis increase the sensitivity to stop production for signal models with a stop mass of 750 GeV,
which is an improvement on the previous result which was sensitive to models with a stop mass up to 650 GeV.
%% of the analysis done using data with pp collisions having an 8 TeV center of mass energy.

The next analysis is a search targeting final states with exactly one lepton, and many jets from hadronic top decay.

The final analysis with exactly one lepton, uses the dphi met W variable to discriminate background from signal.
