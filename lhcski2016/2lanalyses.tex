The rest of the analyses all require at least 2 leptons in the final state.
The first analysis in this category is a search for SUSY in a final state with two same sign leptons.
The next analysis is a search in events with three or more leptons.

The final analysis is a search in final states with at least two opposite-sign same-flavor leptons.
In this final state, two separate excesses were seen in run I.
CMS saw an excess in events with Mll 20-70 GeV with a significance of 2.6 sigma where ATLAS saw no excess,
and ATLAS observed a 3 sigma excess in events with two leptons with Mll 81-101, at least large HT, and large MET,
and the result from CMS in a similar signal region showed no significant deviation from the SM prediction.
